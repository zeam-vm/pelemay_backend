# NodeActivator

<!-- MODULEDOC -->
A module to activate VM nodes.
<!-- MODULEDOC -->

## Installation

In order to use `NodeActivator`, you will need Elixir installed. Then create an Elixir project via the `mix` build tool. For example, if your project is `my_app`, you may run the following command.

```sh
$ mix new my_app
```

Then you can add `NodeActivator` as dependency in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  def deps do
    [
        {:node_activator, "~> 0.1"}
    ]
  end
```

If you are using Livebook or IEx, you can instead run:

```elixir
Mix.install([
    {:node_activator, "~> 0.1"}
])
```
